ChatBot is a pure Javascript / jQuery based chat box with 4 bots interacting with a user. We have a static dictionary where all the bots with their associat replies are stored.

HOW THIS WORKS
User says Hi      >    All 4 Bots reply with their respective replies.    ssdsfs    
User says Hi Bot 1 / Bot 3 how are you      >       Only Bot 1 or 3 will reply if they have any information with the user input
When no answer is found any or all bots then a default message is shown to user saying they did not understand the message
